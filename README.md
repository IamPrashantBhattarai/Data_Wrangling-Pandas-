# Data Wrangling and Insight Extraction

This project focuses on data wrangling and insight extraction from e-commerce product datasets. It uses Python with pandas and other data analysis tools to process, clean, and analyze real-world data to derive insights into the performance and success factors of active sellers.

## 📁 Project Files

- `data_wrangling_student.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing the full data wrangling and analysis workflow.
- `summer-products-with-rating-and-performance_2020-08.csv` – Primary dataset containing information about summer products, their ratings, and performance.
- `computed_insight_success_of_active_sellers.csv` – A cleaned and processed dataset that summarizes the key insights about successful active sellers.

## 📊 Objective

The main goals of this project are:

- To clean and preprocess messy real-world data.
- To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- To compute and export insights such as seller performance metrics and customer engagement indicators.
